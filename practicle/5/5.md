## Aim

Study of Network Simulator (NS)

## Theory

Network Simulator (Version 2), widely known as NS2, is simply an event driven simulation tool that has proved useful in studying the dynamic nature of communication networks. Simulation of wired as well as wireless network functions and protocols (e.g., routing algorithms, TCP, UDP) can be done using NS2. In general, NS2 provides users with a way of specifying such network protocols and simulating their corresponding behaviors. Due to its flexibility and modular nature, NS2 has gained constant popularity in the networking research community since its birth in 1989.

## Basic Architecture

NS2 consists of two key languages: C++ and Object-oriented Tool Command Language (OTcl). While the C++ defines the internal mechanism (i.e., a backend) of the simulation objects, the OTcl sets up simulation by assembling and configuring the objects as well as scheduling discrete events. The C++ and the OTcl are linked together using TclCL

## TCL

Tcl (pronounced "tickle" or as an initialism) is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition.

### Basic Syntax

Tcl commands are composed of words separated by white space. The first word is the name of the command and the remaining words are arguments to the command. The following example shows how to use the puts command to print a string:

```tcl
puts "Hello World"
```

### Comments

Tcl supports two types of comments: single line comments and multi-line comments. Single line comments start with a hash sign (#) and end with a newline character. Multi-line comments start with the string /*and end with the string*/. The following example shows how to use comments:

```tcl
# This is a single line comment
puts "Hello World" # This is a single line comment
puts "Hello World" /* This is a multi-line comment */ puts "Hello World"
```

### Variables

Variables are used to store values. The value of a variable is substituted by its name preceded by a dollar sign. The value of a variable is set using the set command. The set command takes two arguments: the name of the variable and the value to be stored in the variable. The value of a variable can be retrieved using the set command with only one argument: the name of the variable. The following example shows how to use variables:

```tcl
set a 10
set b 20
```

### Control Structures

Tcl has the usual control structures such as if, while, for, and switch. The if command takes a condition and a body of code to execute if the condition is true. The condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value. The body of code is a Tcl script enclosed in braces. The following example shows how to use the if command:

```tcl
if {$a < $b} {
    puts "$a is less than $b"
} else {
    puts "$a is greater than or equal to $b"
}
```

## Initialization and Termination of TCL Script in NS-2

To initialize an NS simulation, the first line in the TCL script should declare a new variable using the `set` command as follows:

```tcl
set ns [new Simulator]
```

The variable `ns` represents an instance of the `Simulator` class, which is created using the reserved word `new`.

To create output files for simulation trace data and visualization, use the `open` command as follows:

```tcl
# Open the Trace file
set tracefile1 [open out.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tracefile1

# Open the NAM trace file
set namfile [open out.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $namfile
```

These commands create a data trace file called `out.tr` and a visualization trace file called `out.nam`. The files are not called explicitly by name within the TCL script, but by pointers declared above as `tracefile1` and `namfile`, respectively. Note that these pointers begin with the `#` symbol. The `trace-all` method is used to record all simulation traces in the `out.tr` file, and the `namtrace-all` method is used to record the visualization trace in the `out.nam` file.

To terminate the program, use the `finish` procedure as follows:

```tcl
# Define a 'finish' procedure
proc finish {} {
  global ns tracefile1 namfile
  $ns flush-trace
  close $tracefile1
  close $namfile
  exec nam out.nam &
  exit 0
}
```

The `proc` command declares a procedure called `finish`, which takes no arguments. The `global` command is used to indicate that variables declared outside the procedure will be used. The `flush-trace` method dumps the traces on the respective files, and the `close` command closes the trace files defined earlier. The `exec` command executes the `nam` program for visualization, and the `exit` command ends the application and returns the number `0` as a status to the system.

At the end of the NS program, call the `finish` procedure and specify the time at which the termination should occur, as follows:

```tcl
$ns at 125.0 "finish"
```

This command schedules the `finish` procedure to run at time 125 seconds using the `at` method of the simulator, which allows us to schedule events explicitly.

To define a network of links and nodes, create a node using the following command:

```tcl
set n0 [$ns node]
```

The `node` command creates a node and prints it using the variable `n0`. To refer to that node in the script, use `$n0`.

To define links that connect nodes, use the following command:

```tcl
$ns duplex-link $n0 $n2 10Mb 10ms DropTail
```

This command connects nodes `$n0` and `$n2` using a bi-directional link with a propagation delay of 10ms and a capacity of 10Mb per second for each direction. To define a directional link instead of a bi-directional one, replace `duplex-link` with `simplex-link`.

To define an output queue of a node, include it as part of each link whose input is that node. The following command sets the buffer capacity of the queue related to a link:

```tcl
# Set Queue Size of link (n0-n2) to 20
$ns queue-limit $n0 $n2 20
```

To define routing (sources, destinations), agents (protocols), and applications that use them, follow the examples below.

For FTP over TCP:

```tcl
# Create a TCP agent
set tcp [new Agent/TCP]

# Define the source node of the TCP connection
$ns attach-agent $n0 $tcp

# Define the behavior of the destination node of TCP
set sink [new Agent/TCPSink]

# Assign a pointer called 'sink' to the destination node
$ns attach-agent $n4 $sink

# Make the TCP connection between the source and destination nodes
$ns connect $tcp $sink

# Set the flow identification of the TCP connection to '1'
$tcp set fid_1

# Set the packet size of the TCP connection to 552 bytes
$tcp set packetSize_ 552
```

For CBR over UDP:

```tcl
# Create a UDP agent
set udp [new Agent/UDP]

# Define the source node of the UDP connection
$ns attach-agent $n1 $udp

# Define the behavior of the destination node of UDP
set null [new Agent/Null]
$ns attach-agent $n5 $null
$ns connect $udp $null

# Set the flow identification of the UDP connection to '2'
$udp set fid_2

# Create a CBR application using the UDP agent
set cbr [new Application/Traffic/CBR]
$cbr attach-agent $udp
$cbr set packetsize_ 100
$cbr set rate_ 0.01Mb
$cbr set random_ false

# Define the destination node of the CBR application
$ns attach-agent $n4 $sink

# Schedule the beginning and end of the FTP and CBR applications
$ns at 0.1 "$cbr start"
$ns at 1.0 " $ftp start"
$ns at 124.0 "$ftp stop"
$ns at 124.5 "$cbr stop"
```

### Scheduling Events

To schedule events, use the `at` method of the simulator as follows:

```tcl
$ns at <time> <event>
```

Note that NS is a discrete event-based simulation, and events are scheduled using the `at` method. The scheduler is started when running NS using the `run` command.

## Result

We have studied the Network Simulator 2 (NS2) in detail.
